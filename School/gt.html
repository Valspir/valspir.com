<font size="5" color="#53aff5">In the movie Gran Torino, we are introduced to the character Walt Kowalski, he is portrayed as a racist,<br> prejudice and bitter old man. Walt is a war veteran from the Korean War, this is shown extensively<br> as his neighbourhood begins to fill with Hmong people. One of his neighbours,<br> Thao, tries to steal his car, a Gran Torino that he has been restoring. Thao was pressured into stealing the car by<br> his cousin to get into a gang. Walt catches Thao in his garage late one night and stops him from <br>stealing the car with his gun. The gang attacks Thao after he fails to steal the car, but Walt<br> fights off the gang, causing Thao’s family to bring him dishes of Hmong food and thank him repeatedly.<br> This is the first time Walt is shown as the good guy and starts him on a road to helping and appreciating <br>his neighbours. Walt quickly changes from the evil in the story to the hero, two juxtaposed ideas.<br> During the movie, Walt saves Thao’s sister, Sue, from gang members and takes her home safely, <br>this is another point that he is shown as a hero in the story. Walt decides to help Thao get a job<br> and gives him dating and conversation advice. Walt stands up for Thao when he is beaten<br> on his way home from work by the gang members, holding one of them at gunpoint<br> and telling him to send a message to the rest of the gang. This causes the gang to drive-by shoot<br> the Hmong family’s house and beat and rape Sue. Walt decides to go to the gang’s<br> house and influences them to kill him, causing all of the gang members to get arrested. Walt dies <br>in the end, but he saves the Hmong family from terrorization by the gang. He sacrificed himself <br>for the family, even though at the beginning of the movie, he would’ve let them die without any second thoughts.</font>
