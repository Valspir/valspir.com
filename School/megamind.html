<font size="5" color="#53aff5">Megamind is a movie about a villain turned good once his enemy was killed. The movie follows the perspective<br> of the ‘Super Villain’ Megamind, the movie starts off with him falling to his death, then rewinds<br> to the very beginning. Megamind was raised as an outcast, which caused him to blossom into a villain,<br> he was always outdone by his nemesis ‘Metro Man’. Even as a child ‘Metro Man’ would outdo him,<br> which helped Megamind become a villain and Metro Man a hero. After Metro Man’s fall, Megamind grew bored<br> of having control of Metro City and decided to create a new hero to battle, but the new hero, ‘Titan’,<br> grows mad with power, and becomes a villain too, this causes Megamind to convert to a hero to save Metro City.<br> Megamind’s change is abrupt but noticeable, it is also influenced by Roxanne Ritchi, a news reporter.<br> Megamind impersonates Metro Man to scare away Hal/Titan, but his plan backfires when his mispronounces<br> Metro City as ‘metrosity’, which Hal/Titan knows Megamind does frequently. Megamind’s change of character<br> is a classic switch from good to evil, which is present in most movies that battle with the idea.</font>
